Duke Nodelki (Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore) will move by and often change directions. He'll occasionally teleport around, shoot magic at the player, or, in his pinch/panic state, teleport to a spot where he will momentarily stay in the air and shoot a barrage of magic. In his pinch/panic state, his movement speed and projectile speed will slightly increase by 0.5. It takes 6 strong hits or 24 fireballs to enter pinch/panic state, and it takes the same amount to finally defeat him.

Duke Nodelki requires the following waypoint tags:

nodelkiteleport		for teleporting around as he moves
nodelkibarrage		for teleporting before he shoots a barrage of his magic
